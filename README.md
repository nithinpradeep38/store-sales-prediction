# store-sales-prediction

Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

Using the classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing, we try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case. We try to build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the
different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.
